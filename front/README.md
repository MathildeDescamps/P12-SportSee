# Getting Started

Make sure to not use a Node version that is too old, v12 and above should work.
If not, try higher ! 
Same rule for your npm version.

Once the project is installed on your computer, navigate to front/ and run :
    `npm install`
    This will install all the dependencies that we need.

Then you can repeat the process in the back/ folder.

Once the previous steps are behind, you can go ahead and run :
    `npm run dev` in the back/ folder, 
    `npm start` in the front/ folder.

You can now open your favorite browser and go to :
    http://localhost:3000 to view the app
    http://localhost:8000 to checkout the api
